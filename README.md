# ENUMERATE!

This repository will help you learn about Ruby's `Enumerable` mixin and
`Enumerator` class through behaviour-driven exploration. Each method is driven
out with a set of specs to document the behaviour with actual running code.

This is not a definitive exploration of every method, merely a tour of some of
the most useful and less well known methods. It's worth reading through [the
documentation for `Enumerable`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html)
to learn all that Ruby can do with enumerables.

**NOTE:** This exercise assumes Ruby v2.2 or better.
